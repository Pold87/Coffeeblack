## Files

- getcontext.py

Get the contexts for one runid

- evaluation.py

Run one policy and evaluate the results of one run (take the mean of
the rewards).

- visualize.py

Started to write small scripts for displaying contexts with Seaborn.

- thompson_policy.py

Implemented thompson sampler based on
http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v28/agrawal13.pdf .  I
think this is an pold version and the correct one is is bandits.py
(LinearPolicy).


- bandits.py

Currently, create_bayesian_arms() only updates mu but not the
distribution of the other parameters.
